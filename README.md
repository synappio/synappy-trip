# synappy-trip
Please create a vacation planning app called "Synappy Trip". Your app will allow users to input arrival and departure times, specify accomodation information, and create a list of fun activities to enjoy. You can invite your travel mates to view the trip you have planned. Remember, your users may be on a desktop computer or a mobile device. It's great if the app is beautiful, but you are being evaluated for coding skills not design ability.

Use whatever tools and frameworks you would like. For your example app, no server-side code is expected. Make as much as possible work offline.

Expected features:
* Manage a list of users the list is shared with
* View and edit arrival and departure times
* View and edit the name and address of your accomodations
* Add / edit / delete a list of activities
* All users may comment on the activities

When submitting your code, please answer the following questions:
1) What additional features might be useful for this app?
2) What would you change in this app to make it work with a webserver backend?
3) What was the most difficult part of writing this app?
